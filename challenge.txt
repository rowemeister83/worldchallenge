 Hi Pawel,

the msql commands that I'd entered, up until you provided the solutions:

use world;
show tables;

describe city; 

select * from country;

#1
SELECT * from CITY;
Select count(CountryCode) FROM city WHERE CountryCode="usa";
#answer is 274

select * from country;

#2
Select population FROM country WHERE name="argentina";
Select lifeexpectancy FROM country WHERE name="argentina";
#answer is 37032000/75.1

#3
Select * from country where lifeexpectancy IS NOT NULL order by lifeexpectancy desc limit 1;
#answer is andorra

#4
select co.name, ci.name from country co join city ci on co.capital = ci.id where co.name = 'Spain';
#result is madrid

#5

SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage cl JOIN country c on cl.COUNTRYCODE=c.CODE WHERE Region='Southeast Asia';
#20 total

#6
SELECT * FROM city WHERE name LIKE 'f%'LIMIT 25;
#25 total results 

#7 
SELECT count(CountryCode) from city c JOIN country ct on ct.CODE=c.COUNTRYCODE WHERE Code='CHN';
#answer is 363

#8
SELECT name, Population FROM COUNTRY WHERE Population=(SELECT MIN(population) FROM COUNTRY WHERE population>0);

#9

#answer is 239
